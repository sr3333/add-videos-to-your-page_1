					  "Recap on vocabulary: Class, Constructor, self, Instances: Variables, Methods.  The class Keyword allows us to make classes. You can think of a class as a blueprint. And a class can have both data and methods. We can create multiple instances of a class. In this example we created instances like Toy Story and Avatar. We could have created many more. When we create an instance of a class, instance like Toy Story, the classes constructor gets called. This is essentially the init method inside the class. It is here that we initialize all of the data associated with the instance. The constructor uses the keyword, self. Now, you can think of self as itself or the instance in question. So, when the instance Toy Story is getting created, self is Toy Story. All the variables associated with a specific instance are called instance variables.These are unique to an object and can be accessed using the self keyword inside the class and the instance name outside the class. All of the functions inside the class that are associated with an instance and have the first argument as self are called instance methods. So there you have it. All of the new words that we have learned thus far, right there on one screen.",</p>

Variables that can be shared, example the variable valid ratings for a movie. This is an array or a list, of all possible ratings a movie could have. Now, it would not quite make sense to say, hey, here are Toy Story's valid ratings, and here are Avatar's valid ratings. They would essentially be the same for all instances. Thus, this variable is really associated with a Class Movie. And is therefore called a Class Variable. Note that this variable valid ratings is defined at the level of the class and is outside the init function. Note the class name movie to access this variable. This means that all instances of this class movie. Toy Story, Avatar and others, they can share this list, they can share this list to see if their individual rating is a valid one or not. ",</p>

Now, let's think about the meaning of this word inheritance and how we use it in the English language.You may have heard someone say that a child can inherit some traits from their parents. Things like the last name, the eye color, some money. So, if we were to take this meaning of inheritance, like we commonly use it in the English language, and turn it into code or model this in terms of programming, we would create a class called Parent. Which would have some attributes like last name and eye color. And then we would make a class called class Child that would inherit these two things from the class Parent. Additionally, the class Child could have another variable of its own called number of toys. Now, you may notice that if we design code like this, we are already beginning to reuse code, which is a huge advantage of object oriented programming.",</p>

                One of the biggest advantage of using Object oriented Programming with Python is the ability to reuse codes. It also allows us to follow intuitive method of prgramming in our brain.  We will be able to map the logic of how the programming code should be written in our brain.
                Python also contains standard library.  The Standard Library is an extensive wide range of built-in modules (which some are written in C) that provides accesses to system functionality.  It accesses functions such as file I/O that would be inaccessible to python programmers and python modules written in Python.
                The Library also contains built-in functions and exceptions - objects that can be used without the need to use "import" statement.
                The use of the library is to find modules that would allow programmers to use its list of modules to save time in their programming.  Instead of re-creating a code to perform a sepcific task/ funtion or module the built in module can be used to eliminate these steps.
